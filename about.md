Pu-Chin Chen (陳步青) is a Master student in the Departments of Computer Science at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA). His research focuses on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning, aiming to acquire complex knowledge from unstructured data. As a researcher in UCLA NLP Lab supervised by Prof. Kai-Wei Chang, Pu-Chin is working on Coreference Resolution systems and currently engaging in Question Answering tasks. Before coming to UCLA, he has received his bachelor degree in Computer Science from National Taiwan University in 2015.

To put theory into practice, Pu-Chin started from two industrial experiences in Taiwan. As a machine learning engineer in KKBOX, he improved music genre classification system for personalized recommendations. By utilizing deep learning algorithms, audio signals were extracted into musical attributes. Classic NLP techniques were later adapted for representation learning on lyrics. During the data science internship at FarEasTone Telecommunication Co., he optimized MySQL queries in a large-scale database with 300X improvement and forecasted customer lifestyles using time series clustering. These experiences enhanced his abilities to write reliable and reusable code, and made him familiarize with agile software development.
